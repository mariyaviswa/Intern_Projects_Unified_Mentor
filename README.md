<p align = "justify">
The 1-month virtual internship at Unified Mentor offered a comprehensive learning experience in data 
analysis and data science, providing hands-on projects to reinforce essential technical skills. I 
discovered and enrolled in this opportunity online, which included structured learning modules and real-world projects for practical experience.

During my internship at Unified Mentor, I worked on analyzing complex datasets for Foreign Direct 
Investment and FIFA World Cup tournaments, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in data analysis 
and visualization. I learned to identify key trends and patterns by working with large datasets, and extracting 
insights that highlight important economic factors and performance indicators. This experience 
enhanced my ability to clean and preprocess data, apply statistical techniques, and present findings 
effectively. Through these projects, I also improved my understanding of how data-driven insights can 
support strategic decision-making and convey meaningful stories about global investment and sports 
performance.

The program consisted of two major projects, each focusing on different aspects of data science and Analytics:

<h3>1. Foreign Direct Investment Analysis</h3>
<p align = "justify">
 This project involved a detailed analysis of global FDI data to 
reveal patterns and trends in international investment flows. I cleaned and preprocessed the data, 
and conducted a thorough analysis to identify influential factors—such as economic indicators and 
sector-based preferences—that impact foreign investments in different countries. Through data 
visualization, I presented insights into how FDI trends evolve and highlighted strategic 
opportunities for targeted growth. This project deepened my understanding of economic data 
analysis and helped me strengthen my skills in extracting actionable insights from large datasets.

<h3>2. FIFA World Cup Analysis</h3>
<p align = "justify">
 For this project, I analyzed historical data from FIFA World Cups to 
identify performance trends and success factors among teams. I explored various game statistics, 
scoring patterns, and defensive strategies to uncover what contributes to winning outcomes in 
competitive football. To present findings effectively, I created a dashboard in Tableau, which 
allowed for interactive exploration of key metrics and made insights easily accessible. This 
experience helped me understand the value of visualization tools like Tableau in simplifying 
complex data and displaying it in a way that highlights meaningful trends.
